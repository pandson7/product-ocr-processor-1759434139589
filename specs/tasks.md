    - Add DynamoDB integration for storing results
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1_

- [ ] 6. Configure Lambda function deployment and environment
    - Package Lambda function with required dependencies
    - Set environment variables for configuration
    - Configure memory, timeout, and runtime settings
    - Set up dead letter queue for error handling
    - _Requirements: 2.4, 5.2_

- [ ] 7. Connect S3 events to Lambda function
    - Configure S3 bucket notification to trigger Lambda
    - Set up proper event filtering for image files

- [ ] 9. Generate architecture diagram
    - Create visual architecture diagram using aws-diagram-mcp-server
    - Include all AWS services and their interactions
    - Save diagram as PNG file in generated-diagrams folder
    - Document data flow and security boundaries
    - _Requirements: All requirements for documentation_

- [ ] 10. Validate and test with sample images
    - Copy sample product images from main project images folder
    - Upload test images to S3 bucket
    - Verify OCR processing and specification extraction
    - Validate DynamoDB storage and data integrity
    - Test error handling scenarios
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.3, 4.3_
