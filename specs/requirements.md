# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This system enables automated product specification extraction from images using AWS cloud services. Users can upload product images to AWS S3, which triggers automated OCR processing using AWS Bedrock's Claude model to extract structured product information and store it in a flexible database schema.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Image Upload and Storage
**User Story:** As a system user, I want to upload product images to AWS storage, so that they can be processed automatically for specification extraction.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a product image is uploaded to the designated S3 bucket THE SYSTEM SHALL store the image securely with appropriate metadata
2. WHEN an image is successfully uploaded THE SYSTEM SHALL trigger the OCR processing pipeline automatically
3. WHEN an image upload fails THE SYSTEM SHALL log the error and provide appropriate error handling

### Requirement 2: Automated OCR Processing
**User Story:** As a system operator, I want images to be automatically processed using AI-powered OCR, so that product specifications can be extracted without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN an image is uploaded to S3 THE SYSTEM SHALL automatically trigger a Lambda function for processing
2. WHEN the Lambda function executes THE SYSTEM SHALL use AWS Bedrock Claude model to analyze the product image
3. WHEN OCR processing completes THE SYSTEM SHALL extract product specifications in structured JSON format
4. WHEN OCR processing fails THE SYSTEM SHALL log errors and implement retry logic

### Requirement 3: Product Specification Extraction
**User Story:** As a data consumer, I want product specifications extracted in a structured format, so that the information can be easily processed and stored.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN Claude model analyzes a product image THE SYSTEM SHALL extract product name, brand, and other relevant specifications
2. WHEN specifications are extracted THE SYSTEM SHALL format the output as valid JSON
3. WHEN no specifications can be extracted THE SYSTEM SHALL return an appropriate error message
4. WHEN specifications are ambiguous THE SYSTEM SHALL provide confidence scores where applicable

### Requirement 4: Flexible Database Storage
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want product specifications stored in a flexible database schema, so that various product types and attributes can be accommodated.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN product specifications are extracted THE SYSTEM SHALL store them in DynamoDB with a flexible schema
2. WHEN storing specifications THE SYSTEM SHALL include metadata such as processing timestamp and source image reference
3. WHEN duplicate products are processed THE SYSTEM SHALL handle them appropriately without data corruption
4. WHEN database operations fail THE SYSTEM SHALL implement proper error handling and logging

### Requirement 5: Security and Permissions
**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all AWS resources to have appropriate permissions, so that the system operates securely with least privilege access.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN AWS resources are created THE SYSTEM SHALL assign minimal required permissions for each service
2. WHEN Lambda functions execute THE SYSTEM SHALL have access only to required S3 buckets, Bedrock models, and DynamoDB tables
3. WHEN S3 events trigger processing THE SYSTEM SHALL use secure service-to-service communication
4. WHEN accessing Bedrock models THE SYSTEM SHALL use the specified Claude model with proper IAM policies
